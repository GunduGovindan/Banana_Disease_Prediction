# Banana_Disease_Prediction
A deep learning classification model to classify various diseases and deficiencies occurring in Banana plant using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). The dataset consists of images of different varieties of banana plants and various classes of diseases andÂ deficiencies.

This model uses the idea of CNN-Convolutional Neural Network to predict the diseases and deficiencies using images of banana plant leaves.We have proposed many refinements and coded a model with a validation accuracy of 99.19% and with a perfect f1 score of 1.However, the model can still be improved by tuning parameters, 
applying different regularization techniques and experimenting with different variations of the architecture.The model can further be improved by properly applying appropriate generative AI techniques like GANs so that the model can be trained better with more data.In conclusion, the refined model seems to show promising results, but still has scope for improvement.
